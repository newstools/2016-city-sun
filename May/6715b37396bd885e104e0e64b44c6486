Rating agency Moody&#8217;s has awarded ANC run Ekurhuleni the highest investment rating, placing it at Aaa level. The city jumped four places up on a scale as compared from the previous year. High investment rating means the city will pay lower interest on its loans compared with its counterparts with lower ratings.&#8220;This rating makes it easier for the city to compete in the international bond markets as well as other project finance and investment opportunities to address infrastructure funding,&#8221; said city manager, Khaya Ngema.Moody&#8217;s also noted that Ekurhuleni has a golden area of opportunity on it&#8217;s industrial base.The latest ratings fly at the face of the Democratic Alliance as it has always claimed that Cape Town is the best run city in the country. comments
