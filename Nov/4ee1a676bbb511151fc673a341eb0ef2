A Sunday Times report has confirmed that the new Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has laid criminal charges against her predecessor Thuli Madonsela.This comes after the former Public Protector publicly admitted to have leaked recording of her interview with President Jacob Zuma. Madonsela did not just leak the recording but she also distributed them to some media houses.The Public Protector act strongly bars anyone in the office of the Public Protector from to distributing information which is a subject of investigations. Acoording to Sunday Times report, Mkhwebane opened the case with the police because the handing over of the recording was in contravention of the Public Protector s Act.Madonsela initially denied that she had leaked the recording but when pressure mounted she finally admitted.Advocate Mkhwebane earlier received a complaint from President Zuma about leaked recording which was circulated on social media. Media houses that did not receive the recording from Madonsela also laid complaints and criticized her for working with certain news agencies.The Public Protector Act clearly states that no contents of any document in an investigation should be disclosed. When Madonsela denied leaking the recording, she cited this section of the act. It is not clear as to why she later decided to go against her own words and leak the information to media agencies. comments
