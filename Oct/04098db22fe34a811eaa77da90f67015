The Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled in favour of President Zuma, granting him permission to have his lawyers argue in open court before a decision is made. After a hearing behind closed doors on Wednesday, the Supreme Court of Appeal shockingly decided that President Jacob Zuma’s lawyers can now argue as to why his application for leave to appeal must be granted. This decision means that Zuma lawyers will now present their application for leave to appeal, and then the merits of the case. In normal circumstances, a court would decide to hear the application, adjourn, and then return to interrogate the merits. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) withdrew the charges in 2009 after Zuma made representations which proved that former President Mbeki’s executive interfered with the process.
