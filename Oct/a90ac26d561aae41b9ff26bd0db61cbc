The new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has told parliamentarians that her office needs more funding in order to fulfill its duties. Her office’s annual report reveals that R122 million of R262 million has already been spent. But this explanation was not enough as parliamentarians pressed her to provide more details on her office’s spending. It emerged that there is more than R5 million that reflects on her report as irregular spending. “I need to put it on record that I doubt we will have a clean audit the next financial year,” said Mkhwebane. Parliament was also told that there was also a lot of international travel during the period of Advocate Thuli Madonsela as a public protector. It is not clear as to why would she travel overseas so often since her ground work is all in South Africa. “Going forward, I commit no consultation will be utilized in that office, no donor funds will be requested in that office. I discussed with the management as well and they know what is the way forward as far as that is concerned,” she said. “We will try our level best. Whatever is in my control, we will try our level best to make sure that we have an unqualified audit.” Many have taken to social media to demand answers on Thuli Madonsela’s international trips. Concerns have also been expressed about donor funding amounting to $500 000 that was received by he PP’s office. Mkhwebane finally admitted that donor funding could harm the independence of the public protector’s office.
