Questions have been raised about why the DA is accusing Hlaudi of being less qualified for executive position, whereas former SAA CEO Nico Bezuidenhout only had matric. Bezuidenhout who later became Mango Airlines CEO was exposed for not having a single qualification in 2014. He was recently head hunted to become FastJet airline CEO. “I do not believe the fact I did not have a academic qualification when appointed at Mango in 2006 has had any effect,” said Bezuidenhout in an interview with SABC. SABC’s newly appointed Group Executive for Corporate Affairs, Hlaudi Motsoeneng has been criticized on social media for being less qualified for any executive position in the corporation. Over the weekend Motsoeneng decided to write an open letter which revealed his qualification and experience. Hlaudi successfully completed the Leadership Development Programme, Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) which is NQF Level 7. He also holds a National Certificate in Generic Management, (Prodigy): NQF Level 5. Additional to these Hlaudi holds a Higher Certificate and the Thompson Foundation Certificate in Radio Journalism; Analysis of Contemporary Social Issues from Wits university. “I just think that black people of this country are facing a very difficult time and have to prove themselves beyond reasonable doubt. White fellows are having it very easy and media is helping them enjoy white privilege,” said Thembinkosi Hadebe who is a social media analysts at Blue Skies Media.
