DA leader Mmusi Maimane is demanding that the new Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane furnishes him with a copy of state capture report. This move goes against a court order that was issued by a judge to have the report preserved. Maimane has written a letter to Mkhwebane demanding his copy of the report, which was completed and signed off by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela last week. Madonsela was hoping to release the report during her last day but a court favored President Zuma and interdected her from doing so. Madonsela had gone against section 7(9) of the Public Protector act which states that any person appearing before the PP has a right to question his accusers before the investigation is concluded. The judge criticized Madonsela for failing to listen to both sides of the story and ordered that she does not release the report before President Zuma is given access to witnesses and provides answers to questions raised. “As the complainant in this matter, I am entitled by law to be provided with a copy of this report, which has been completed according to outgoing Public Protector, Advocate Thuli Madonsela,” said Maimane. “Section 8(3) of the Public Protector Act states that ‘the findings of an investigation by the Public Protector shall, when he or she deems it fit but as soon as possible, be made available to the complainant and to any person implicated thereby’,” he said.
