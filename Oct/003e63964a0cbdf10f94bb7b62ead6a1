Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane has called on advertisers to quit SABC. But his call exposes his ignorance about how advertising works for brands. Maimane believes that advertisers pay money to SABC with the intention to invest in the corporation, which is completely incorrect. “I want to call upon all the people who are advertising here‚ that let us remind the SABC that we can’t keep on pouring money into an institution that is losing money and is a propaganda machine. Therefore if you are a business‚ you must use this time wisely and stop saying to yourself you will invest in an institution that is undermining our people‚” said Mmusi Maimane. It is not clear whether any advertiser will heed Maimane’s call as advertisers compete for SABC ads slots because of millions of viewers to tune on various channels. SABC reportedly lost R411 million which is below R1 billion which was a projected loss. The corporation’s CEO James Aguna has maintained that SABC is solvent despite revenue losses.
