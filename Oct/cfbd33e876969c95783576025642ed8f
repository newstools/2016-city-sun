News broke over the weekend that Khwezi, the woman who accused President of rape had passed away. Social media was buzzing with messages of support and condolences to Khwezi’s family. Handing down his judgement, Judge Willem van der Merwe asked very critical questions about Khwezi’s rape claim. “Why would a man be so foolish to start raping a sleeping woman if he did not know whether she would scream her head off, especially with a uniformed policeman and his daughter nearby,” asked Judge van der Merwe. Khwezi had also tried to convince the court that she was a close friend of one of Zuma’s daughters. This could only have been Duduzile. But, Duduzile testified she was “irritated” when she saw the alleged victim because she thought she was only at her father’s house to ask for money. Khwezi also did not recognise Duduzile when she first saw her. The judge said the complainant had tried to convince the court that she had a “deep, father-daughter relationship” with Zuma, who denied this. According to evidence there were long periods when she did not see Zuma or had any contact with him. Judge Willem did not have a choice but to reject the evidence of two police officers, saying he was not impressed by them and could therefore not accept their version. Commissioner Norman Taioe, head of Gauteng’s detective services, and Superintendent Peter Linda, the investigating officer, testified against Zuma. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
