President Zuma is entitled, according to section 7(9) of the Public Protector Act, to question witnesses in the investigation into claims that the controversial Gupta family has had a hand in government appointments. The Public Protector act states that: “a person (who appears before the Public Protector) or his or her legal representative shall be entitled, through the Public Protector, to question other witnesses, determined by the Public Protector, who have appeared before the Public Protector in terms of this section.” Yesterday President Zuma wrote to Madonsela and requested her to give him permission to question some witnesses. Madonsela has no choice but to grant Zuma the right to do so as per provisions of Section 7(9) of the act. If granted, this will give Zuma more ammunition to blast some witnesses who are already accused of lying in order to strengthen Madonsela’s weak case of alleged state capture. It has also emerged that Madonsela acted against the act by giving Zuma only two days to respond to questions. The act states that the person appearing before the Public Protector “shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard in connection therewith by way of giving evidence.” Despite short notice Zuma has complied with Madonsela’s illegal demand. The audi alteram audi partem (listen to the other side) rule of the administrative law gives Zuma the right to gain access to the documents and records gathered in the course of the investigation, to enable him to prepare his evidence.
