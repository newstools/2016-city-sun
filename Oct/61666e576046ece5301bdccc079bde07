The newly appointed Public Protector Busisiwe Mkwebane has received warm welcome from ordinary people on social media platforms. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane was officially appointed to the position on Thursday morning by President Jacob Zuma. She will take over the reins on October 15 for the period of seven years. Mkhwebane’s nomination as the next public protector was confirmed by the National Assembly almost a month ago‚ and Zuma’s announcement on Thursday confirmed its “recommendation”. Her recommendation came with some controversy after the Democratic Alliance made spy claims about Mkhwebane‚ saying it was “suspicious” that she was “on the payroll” of the State Security Agency. Khwebane has already hinted that she will prioritize cases that involve ordinary citizens whose rights are infringed. The outgoing Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has been accused for neglecting thousands of cases that did not give her media attention.
