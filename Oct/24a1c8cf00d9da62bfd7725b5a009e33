Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba has been warned that withdrawal from Salga comes with dire consequences for the municipality.  This emerged as The SA Local Government Association (Salga) dismissed the decision by Mashaba to withdraw funds from the organisation. “Salga is a membership-based organisation‚ meaning that municipalities are direct members with their respective contributions to and participation within Salga being determined by municipal councils‚” Salga spokesperson Sivuyile Mbambato said. “The withdrawal of funds is assumed to mean the ‘withdrawal of membership’ from Salga‚ which will require a formal sitting of the municipal council with a specific resolution taken to withdraw such membership; (or) alternatively a specific delegation given by the municipal council to the executive mayor to facilitate such withdrawal. “Withdrawal of membership is within the municipal council’s discretion but does come with dire consequences for the municipality as a whole.” Few weeks ago Mashaba threatened the withdrawal of Johannesburg municipality from funding Salga after Parks Tau was appointed as the chairperson of the organisation. Mashaba accused Salga of being a cadre deployment body for the African National Congress that has become top-heavy and wasteful in its spending. He also accused the the body of having strayed from its mandate‚ which is to empower local government councillors and to act as their spokesperson in the national arena.
