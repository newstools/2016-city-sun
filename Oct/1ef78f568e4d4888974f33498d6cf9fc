Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa fully recognize the role and the constitutional mandate for NPA in performing its function. Ramaphosa also indicated that he supports Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan as he faces charges brought against him by the National Prosecuting Authority. “I am fully cognisant of the role that the NPA has to play in building a democratic society. In this regard, we respect the constitutional mandate that the NPA has to discharge without fear, favour or prejudice. This mandate has to be balanced against the constitutional rights of all individuals, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. The situation requires of all South Africans to demonstrate unity in defence of constitutional values, the integrity of our legal system and the objective of setting South Africa on a path of sustainable and inclusive economic growth that will help us overcome poverty, unemployment and inequality.” said Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa went on to wish Minister Gordhan well as he prepares to deliver the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement. He hopes that this challenge will not distract him from focusing on this important national task.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
