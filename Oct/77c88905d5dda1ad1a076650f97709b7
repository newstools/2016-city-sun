The woman who falsely accused President Zuma of rape, known as Khwezi has died. Handing down the judgement, Judge Willem van der Merwe found that Khwezi had lied about being raped by Zuma. “Why would a man be so foolish to start raping a sleeping woman if he did not know whether she would scream her head off, especially with a uniformed policeman and his daughter nearby,” questioned Judge van der Merwe. The judge said the complainant had tried to convince the court that she had a “deep, father-daughter relationship” with Zuma, who denied this. According to evidence there were long periods when she did not see Zuma or had any contact with him. Khwezi had also tried to convince the court that she was a close friend of one of Zuma’s daughters. This could only have been Duduzile. But, Duduzile testified she was “irritated” when she saw the alleged victim because she thought she was only at her father’s house to ask for money. The complainant also did not recognise Duduzile when she first saw her. Judge Willem also rejected the evidence of two police officers, saying he was not impressed by them and could therefore not accept their version. Commissioner Norman Taioe, head of Gauteng’s detective services, and Superintendent Peter Linda, the investigating officer, testified against Zuma. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
