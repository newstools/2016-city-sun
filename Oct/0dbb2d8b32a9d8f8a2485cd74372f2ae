The Pretoria High Court has ruled against Public Protector Thuli Madonsela on a matter brought by BLF. Yesterday the court overturned Madonsela’s decision to remove BLF demonstrators from office. BLF protestors have been camping outside the public protector’s office since last week. They accuse Madonsela of refusing to accept their memorandum which compels her to investigate white monopoly capital. They further claim that Gupta family is only involved in R230 million state capture allegation whereas more than R180 billion disappeared and she has since not investigated that. Madonsela is also accused of refusing to follow the public protector’s act which entitles President Zuma the right to question witnesses in a case involving Gupta family. Section 7(9) of the act states that any person appearing before the public protector has a right to question witnesses and to gain access to their evidence transcripts. Madonsela has since failed to respond to Zuma’s request.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
